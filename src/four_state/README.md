# Analysis Tools and Utilities for the Four-State Method

This directory provides a set of utility programs that assist with selecting supercells and preparing inputs for calculating **Heisenberg exchange interactions** in the **SUPERHEX** workflow using the *four-state method*.

---

## Available Tools

### 1. `find-cell.py`

This analysis tool helps determine which exchange interactions can be computed for each supercell generated by SUPERHEX. They inspect symmetry, atomic connectivity, and neighbor relations to determine the valid pairs needed for the four-state technique.


## Workflow

```text
SUPERHEX → generate supercells → run find-cell.py → output valid exchange pairs
                                                            |
                                                            → all_valid_neighbors.csv
                         

```

#### Usage

```text
python find-cell.py -h

or 

python find-cell.py -i params-find.in 
```
