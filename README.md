# superhex

**Super**cell Optimization for **H**eisenberg **Ex**change Calculations (**SUPERHEX**) 
is a code designed to generate the smallest possible supercell structures for mapping ab initio results (such as DFT) 
to the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, facilitating the derivation of exchange interactions.
