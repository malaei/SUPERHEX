Tutorial: Running superhex
===========================

In this tutorial, you will learn how to run `superhex` using example files from the `tests` directory.

Step 1: Create a Working Directory
------------------------------------

First, create a directory (named `example` here) outside the code directory, and navigate into it:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir example
    $ cd example

Step 2: Copy the Example Files
-------------------------------

Copy the required example files from the `tests` directory in the `superhex` code:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cp superhex_dir/tests/bulk_examples/MnTe/input.txt .
    $ cp superhex_dir/tests/bulk_examples/MnTe/MnTe.vasp .

Step 3: Understand the Required Input Files
---------------------------------------------

To run `superhex`, you only need:

- An input file (in JSON format), named `input.txt`.
- A structure file (in VASP, CIF, or other formats).

You can find both of these files in the `MnTe` directory.

To view the contents of the `input.txt` file, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cat input.txt

Hereâ€™s an example of what the `input.txt` file might look like:

.. code-block:: json

   {
       "structure_file": "MnTe.vasp",
       "LatDim": 3, 
       "range_volume": true, 
       "volumes": [1, 12],
       "magnetic_atoms": ["Mn"],
       "cutoff_radius": 25,
       "n_configs": 100,
       "all_configs": false, 
       "verbosity": "high",
       "seed": 42, 
       "num_processes": 4
   }

For more details on the input file format, refer to the :ref:`input_format`.


Step 4: Run the superhex Program
----------------------------------

Run the `superhex` program in the `example` directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ superhex

After the run, the following output files will be generated:

- `log.txt`
- `struct_analysis.csv`
- A `supercells` directory containing the generated supercells.


The program indexes each supercell structure by cell volume (denoted as ``m``). For each supercell volume, multiple distinct structures can be generated. These structures are indexed by ``n``, starting from 0 and incrementing to the total number of unique structures for that specific supercell volume. 

Within the ``supercells`` directory, the files are named as: cell-vol ``m`` -num ``n``.vasp, where:
- ``m`` represents the supercell volume, and
- ``n`` is the structure index.

The ``log.txt`` file contains information about the matrix transformations applied to each supercell structure. The details are labeled in the following format:

```
-----volume: m Structure number: n-----
```

Here, ``m`` indicates the supercell volume, and ``n`` refers to the structure index.


The file ``struct_analysis.csv`` contains all the necessary information for selecting an appropriate supercell for exchange calculations.
For this example, the first 30 lines of ``struct_analysis.csv`` are shown below:

- The first column represents the supercell size (or volume), denoted as ``m``.
- The second column indicates the structure number within this volume, denoted as ``n``.
- The third column shows the index of the first dependent column of matrix :math:`\mathbb{A}`, introduced in the :doc:`introduction <intro>`.
- The fourth column specifies the farthest permitted Heisenberg exchange interaction that can be calculated for the structure with volume ``m`` and structure index ``n``.
- The fifth column represents the rank of matrix :math:`\mathbb{A}`.
- The sixth column shows the percentage of independent magnetic configurations generated from random configurations.
- The final column indicates the variation in lattice vectors.


You can use the ``plot_analysis.py`` script in the ``src/tools`` directory to visualize the data from ``struct_analysis.csv``:

.. code-block:: bash

   python plot_analysis.py

.. image:: js_vs_vol.svg  
   :alt: Allowed exchange interactions for supercell structures  
   :align: center

The resulting plot shows the allowed exchange interactions for supercell structures with sizes ranging from 1 to 12. The x-axis represents the supercell sizes, while the y-axis indicates the number of permitted exchange interactions for each structure.
Each supercell size includes several distinct structures. For example, at supercell size 8, there are 34 unique supercell structures. The size of the circles in the plot reflects the number of structures that allow the calculation of a specific number of exchange interactions.


According to the plot, if we want to calculate exchange interactions up to the 7th nearest neighbor (i.e., \( J_1, J_2, \dots, J_7 \)), we can use a supercell of size 8. There are several distinct structures of size 8 that allow the calculation of exchanges up to \( J_7 \).

To find the options, we can use the `grep` command in bash:

.. code-block:: bash

   grep J7 struct_analysis.csv

The first few lines of the result are as follows:

.. code-block:: bash
   8,2,8,J7,9,98.0,22.485831549654435
   8,13,8,J7,9,97.0,5.090066901962643
   8,8,8,J7,9,96.0,8.996710197481613
   8,19,8,J7,9,96.0,21.242606279366886
   8,7,8,J7,9,95.0,5.090066954230983


This shows that we can choose, for example, `cell-vol8-num2.vasp` from the `supercells` directory for calculating exchange interactions up to \( J_7 \).
